# Chapter 2

Deadpool's mask crinkled as if he were raising an eyebrow. "Okay, maybe not chimichanga joints exactly. It’s more like a bunch of important Gotham buildings. You know, classic Joker chaos. Point is, he’s going for a citywide bonanza of boom-booms, and I figured, why not help the ol' Bats out for once? I mean, you're basically Gotham's grumpy dad, right?"

Batman said nothing, though his mind was racing. The Joker’s plans were always convoluted and dangerous, and if this strange mercenary had any useful information, he’d need it.

Deadpool waltzed over to the Bat-Signal, admiring it up close. "Man, this thing is awesome. I need a Deadpool Signal. Just imagine it: a giant taco in the sky, summoning me to save the day. Anyway, Bats, here’s the deal. I’ll give you the Joker’s location, and in return, you let me help you take him down. It'll be fun—a dynamic duo of dysfunctional anti-heroes!"

Batman’s voice was low and dangerous. "I work alone."

Deadpool spun on his heel, dramatically shaking his finger. "Tsk, tsk, tsk. Do you, though? I mean, what about Robin? Or Nightwing? Or Batgirl? You got a whole bat-family, and don’t think I don’t know about Alfred. That dude is the unsung hero of your operation."

Batman stepped forward, looming over Deadpool. "Tell me where the Joker is. Now."
