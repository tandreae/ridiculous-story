# Chapter 4

Deadpool sighed, pulling out a crumpled piece of paper from one of his many pouches. "Fine, fine. Always so serious. Here you go, the address of Joker's new hideout. But I still think we should team up, y'know? We’d be great together—brains and brawn. Well, mostly brawn on your part, and I’ll bring the charm."

Batman snatched the paper, studying the location. "If this is a trick—"

Deadpool held up his hands in mock surrender. "No tricks. Just tacos, teamwork, and maybe a little ultraviolence. But seriously, Bats, you could use some R&R. When was the last time you took a vacation? I know this great little island with zero crime and all-you-can-eat sushi."

Batman ignored him and turned, cape billowing as he prepared to leap off the building. But before he could disappear into the night, Deadpool called after him, "Hey! You’re welcome!"

Without turning, Batman spoke, his voice cold and direct. "Stay out of my city."

Deadpool chuckled, crossing his arms. "Sure thing, boss. But I’ll be back. You know, for a sequel."

As Batman vanished into the darkness, Deadpool sighed contentedly. "Man, what a guy. So broody, so mysterious. Can’t wait to ruin his day again." He pulled out another taco from who knows where and took a bite, admiring Gotham’s skyline.

"Yep, this could be the beginning of a beautiful, violent friendship."
