# Chapter 1

In the dead of night, Gotham City’s skyline shimmered with rain-slicked rooftops under a heavy fog. The Bat-Signal cut through the murk like a lighthouse for the lost. Batman stood on the ledge of Wayne Tower, eyes narrowing beneath his cowl. The night had been quiet, too quiet for Gotham, and he could feel something was off.

Suddenly, a voice broke through the silence.

"Hey, Batsy! Heard you were the brooding type, but man, you take it to a whole new level. Maybe try yoga? Or at least smile more—makes you look less like a vampire."

Batman turned, his fist clenched instinctively. There, standing on the ledge beside him, was a figure clad in red and black, dual katanas strapped to his back, and holding…was that a taco?

"Who are you?" Batman growled, his voice gravelly, more annoyed than curious.
